Sky Systemz Gateway for WooCommerce

Securely accept credit cards using Sky Systemz. The Sky Systemz extension provides our clients the ability to integrate with WooCommerce and process Visa, MasterCard, Discover and other variants of cards. 

Getting started with Sky is easy! Simply register at skysystemz.com, create your environment, and begin accepting in-store & e-commerce payments! Our pricing for the plugin is free, but Sky does charge a processing fee of 3.31% plus 15 cents per e-commerce charge. 


Below are some of the most frequently asked questions:



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= When will I typically receive deposits? =

Sky offers next day funding, so Sky Paymentz customers will receive any payments made on Monday by 9:00 PM ET on Tuesday. Any payments during the weekend will be received on Tuesday.


= Can I process payments immediately after registration? =

Yes. After completing the 5 minute registration process you can immediately start processing payments by using the Sky Systemz mobile application (App Store) ( Google Play) or by logging into SkySystemz.com you can take a manual payment. You will then receive an email and phone call from your dedicated account manager to assist with any hardware purchases and the setup of your Sky account.


= What do I need to create an account? =

Sky asks basic business and personal questions during registration, such as name, address, EIN, and banking information. It takes approximately 5 minutes to complete our registration and begin processing payments. However, Sky uses next generation underwriting and verification technology to identify you as the business owner and to verify your business. If you do not answer questions accurately, we may ask additional questions or require documentation such as processing statements, drivers license, or business licenses for verification purposes.
